Die paläarktisch verbreitete Art zählt zusammen mit der gattungsverwandten Kellerspinne (Amaurobius ferox) sowie der Ähnlichen Fensterspinne (Amaurobius similis) zu den häufigsten der Familie in Europa. Der Trivialname „Fensterspinne“ rührt von der irrtümlichen Annahme her, dass die Art gerne im Bereich von Fenstern lebt. Dies ist mittlerweile widerlegt und ist mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit auf Verwechslungen mit der verwandten Ähnlichen Fensterspinne zurückzuführen, bei der dieses Verhalten vorkommt und die überdies früher nicht als eigene Art von der Fensterspinne unterschieden wurde. Die Fensterspinne selbst bewohnt hingegen bevorzugt Wälder und seltener Keller oder Höhlen. Im englischen Sprachraum wird die Fensterspinne als Window spider oder wie die Ähnliche Fensterspinne als Lace-webbed spider (übersetzt etwa „Spitzenweberspinne“) bezeichnet. Beide englischen Bezeichnungen nehmen Bezug auf das Trichternetz, das wie bei allen Echten Finsterspinnen (Amaurobius) mit cribellater Fangwolle versehen ist. Mit dessen Hilfe erbeutet die nachtaktive Fensterspinne eine Vielzahl von Gliederfüßern und kann auch wehrhafte Vertreter dieses Stammes überwältigen. Das Trichternetz mündet weiter hinten in einer als Aufenthaltsort der Spinne dienenden Wohnröhre, in der ein verpaartes Weibchen später auch seinen Eikokon deponiert. Die geschlüpften Jungtiere verhalten sich wie bei allen Echten Finsterspinnen matriphag, bzw. sie saugen ihre kurz nach dem Schlupf verendende Mutter aus und überwintern gemeinsam in ihrem Netz, ehe sie sich im folgenden Frühjahr trennen und selbstständig heranwachsen.\"\n","]\n","\n","summarize = reload(summarize)\n","summarize.summarize_with_bertsum(texts)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"lbINQ4GpKTHE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645775681076,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":8273,"user":{"displayName":"Zohaib Akhtar Khan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhDxR5SUI_CQuZ4d1iYZsq0ZqAkxd2KNHJ9ahkuVg=s64","userId":"11760862558786327949"}},"outputId":"7f9f0070-772b-4a64-c4cf-cd3025e8703c"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sentence splitting, tokenizing and converting to json...\n","[]\n","[]\n","[('../json_data/temp/test.0.json', <summarize.clsprops object at 0x7fddd0cce5d0>, '../bert_data/temp/test.0.bert.pt')]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[2022-02-25 07:54:33,296 INFO] Ignore ../bert_data/temp/test.0.bert.pt\n","[2022-02-25 07:54:33,538 INFO] Loading checkpoint from ../models/mlsum/mlsum_bertsum_model_step_45000.pt\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<summarize.clsprops object at 0x7fddda2a5d50>\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[2022-02-25 07:54:38,837 INFO] Loading test dataset from ../bert_data/temp/test.0.bert.pt, number of examples: 1\n","[2022-02-25 07:54:38,856 INFO] * number of parameters: 120957953\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["gpu_rank 0\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[2022-02-25 07:54:39,793 INFO] Validation xent: 1.80103 at step 45000\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"gUd_pEW2jhKt"}}]}
